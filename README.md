# 3D Portfolio

Welcome to the 3D Portfolio project! This project showcases my skills and creativity through an interactive 3D experience. The main focus is on presenting my work in a visually engaging manner using React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber.


## Features

- **Interactive 3D Text**: The portfolio features spinning 3D text that showcases my name in a vibrant orange color with a stylish outline.
- **Manual Rotation**: Users can manually rotate the scene to explore the 3D elements.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- **Dark Background Theme**: A modern dark theme enhances visual aesthetics and makes the content stand out.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A 3D library that makes creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in the browser easier.
- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js that enables a declarative approach to building 3D scenes.
- **drei**: A helper library for React Three Fiber that provides useful abstractions and components for easier 3D scene building.
